The Light Vehicles segment addressed the needs of users seeking more active, lower-priced, and efficient options for short trips, especially during heavy traffic, and supplemented multimodal trips with public transit. Additionally, the ridesharing marketplace continued to connect drivers and riders across cities in the United States and Canada, benefiting from predictive technology to optimize driver availability and rider convenience. These segments experienced growth as Lyft expanded its offerings and adapted to changing transportation demands.\n",
